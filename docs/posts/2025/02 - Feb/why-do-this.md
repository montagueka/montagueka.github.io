# Why Do This

For me, mostly. This blog exists for me. Not for anyone else, just for Kaden. Kaden's Blog.

When I was younger I collected YuGiOh cards. I was *obsessed* with the show, and collected the cards like I was a squirrel collecting acorns during those years where Oak trees over-produce acorns and it tricks the squirrels into hiding so many acorns they forget about a lot of them, and then the squirrel population booms because those squirrels were like "fuck yeah, look at all these acorns we got, this winter's gonna be fucking awesome" but then the next year the Oak trees are like "oh, you thought I'd do that *every* year? Yeah, no that was so I could make more saplings. idgaf about your kids, hope they have fun starving to death this year" and then just stand idly by while a bunch of squirrel babies die.

As I was saying, I liked the cards and bought them every chance I had. I worked tirelessly to get these cards - down in the mines, away from fresh sunlight weeks at a time. If I had enough left after the grueling responsibility of childhood I'd throw in my hat at the ol' electronic-Bay to hope I'd have enough money to just barely beat out the other 10 year olds bidding on that full Exodia set. And then wait what felt like months, checking the mail every day, to see if my new cards had arrived.

And when I had them, finally, I'd rush straight to my friends' house (they were brothers, I got the apostrophe right, don't @ me) to show them this cool new awesome thing I had. I didn't get the cards solely because I wanted them, I got them because I wanted to share that excitement with my friends. And maybe gloat about it to them just like a little bit, but they had a PlayStation 2 so I had to establish dominance somehow...

And at some point, I stopped doing that. I don't really know why, or when, but somewhere that childlike attachment to "look at this cool thing" got lost and the friendly one-upsmanship of childhood of who had the coolest YuGiOh card turned into something else. It became "look at this post I made, and how many likes it has."

Social media has always been uncomfortable for me. I shudder at the idea of posting something to the open forum of the internet lest my content be judged by my peers as weird, anti-social, dumb... Every time I interact with someone in an online space I double, triple, and quadruple check my post to ensure it's perfect before I post it. I carefully craft it to the unwritten rules of social interaction online to make sure I'm fitting in. I wouldn't want to do/say something that would make anyone feel uncomfortable for even a moment.

If you know what masking feels like, then you know how uncomfortable this is.

The thing is, though, I never stopped getting excited about little things. I still collect things - it's not YuGiOh cards anymore, but I still get excited about getting some cool new gadget, or a new tool, or a tent. And sometimes I wanna talk about them. I wanna be excited about them again like I was when I was younger. I want the feeling of running over to a friend's house to show them what I got for my birthday and to excitedly explain what was so cool about it.

But, we also live in the world we live in. The internet is a tool, and it has incredible potential for connecting people. But, it's been overrun with giant tech corporations seeking ever growing engagement. The big social media platforms exist solely to keep driving their numbers up - it's not sufficient for you to use their app just to talk to a friend, their app has to be your *home base* on the internet. Top of your apps list, the home page on your browser. Come eat the sweets that the ol' hag is serving, you'll never want to leave! (Ignore the cauldron over the fire, that's not for you, I promise)

But it doesn't have to work this way. These platforms exist and thrive because they make it *easy* to get pulled into them. It's much, much harder to exist online outside this bubble.

But it is possible, and I think it's worth it.

I *want* to know what my friends and family are up to, and I *want* to share with them what I'm up to. But I can't exactly run down the street to show my friends my cool things anymore, so I'm going to try to use the tools I have to recreate this feeling in the digital age.

How is this different than the thousand other platforms that are trying to achieve the same thing? Well I don't actually give a shit about "growth" or "my audience". This isn't a platform, it's a paradigm: take back the internet, own a little corner of it, show it to my friends.

So why do this? For me, to reinvigorate my excitement about the things I'm not sure other people care about.

But if you want to share in my excitement about those things, well then I will be excited about that too.
